#这个是我学习c++的一份代码，实现了地图传送和地图创建的功能，你可以根据自己的喜爱来设计自己的地图传送点也可以加载别人的传送点，我后面会继续学习添加新的功能，如果给我一个全传奇全dlc的账号的话也许我会更有参考的去开发了，总之这是面向学习的代码开发，感谢前人的智慧，并无利益交换，完全免费，如果存在侵权请联系我删除，我大概一个月看一次github，新dlc永恒愿景的箱子点位可以验证功能是否正常，创建自己地图需要有对应的地图模板，文件名就是position不能改，我是放在桌面上的，但是路径应该被我写死了你可以自己去改，我也会发出来，其他人的地图github上也有自己去找下，我也存了只是懒得上传，如果别人删除了的话可以联系我继续上传，对了我在别人的基础上添加了两个点位的存储，这样你就有三个点位的坐标，功能体现的很明显了自己开动一下小脑筋









# KX Trainer Free

KX Trainer Free is a simple game trainer for Guild Wars 2 that we've decided to make open-source. The code has evolved since its origin in 2018, and we believe in transparency for tools like this.

## Why Open-Source?

We believe transparency is important, especially for game tools. KX Trainer Free has been around for a while, and opening it up allows the community to see how it works, learn from it, or contribute.

While our main development efforts focus on the advanced features in our paid tools available at [kxtools.xyz](https://kxtools.xyz), **KX Trainer Free will be actively maintained** to ensure it remains functional after Guild Wars 2 updates and to fix critical bugs. However, new features exclusive to the paid version will not be added here. We hope the community finds this base useful and potentially builds upon it.

## A Little History

Originating as a hobby project in 2018, KX Trainer Free has evolved significantly. The codebase, while functional in its earlier versions, has recently undergone substantial refactoring to improve structure, clarity, and maintainability, resulting in a much cleaner state.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions! Pull requests for **bug fixes**, **compatibility updates** following game patches, or **code improvements** are highly encouraged. While new features mirroring the paid version won't be merged, community-driven additions that fit the scope of the free trainer are welcome for discussion. Your input is valuable in keeping this tool functional for everyone.

## How to Use

KX Trainer Free is a C++ project designed to work on Windows using Visual Studio.
